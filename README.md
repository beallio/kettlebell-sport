# Introduction
Kettlebell Sport information is difficult to find on the internet, or limited in depth,scope,etc. This is my attempt to collect what I find.

## What is Kettlebell Sport?

This is not Hardstyle (Pavel-influended) Kettlbell lifting.  Kettlebell Sport is endurance kettlebell lifting where lifters have 10 minutes (or 5 minutes in sprint sets) to complete as many reps as possible without setting the bells down.  Efficiency and technique are important to maintain energy throughout set.  

### Lifts
- Long Cycle - Clean and Jerk.  Commonly performed with 2 kettlebells, but one-arm variants performed for half-marathon and marathon.  Abbrevations include: LC (long cycle), TALC (two-arm long cycle), C+J (clean and jerk), OALC (one-arm long cycle).
- Snatch - Snatch.  Performed with one kettlebell.  Double-arm variant referred to as Double Snatch.
- Jerk - Jerk. Commonly performed with 2 kettlebells, but one-arm variants performed for half-marathon and marathon.  Abbrevations include: OAJ (one-arm jerk).
- Half-snatch.  Commonly performed with 1 kettlebell for half-marathon and marathon events, but the two-arm variant is becoming more popular.  Abbrevations include: HS (one-arm half-snatch), DHS (two-arm half-snatch).

### Miscellaneous
- [TrueGrit Kettleweights](https://www.truegritkettlebell.com/shop/) - 1KG and 2KG magnetic plates you attach to base of Kettlebell.  Allows you to adjust weight in smaller increments than traditional 4KG jumps between bells.
    - I'm not a big fan of attachment plates, because they shift during two-bell sets.  I prefer a set of adjustables to fill the 2kg gaps if you can't afford bells in 2kg increments, or lack the storage space.
- ~~[Vikn Chalk](https://viknperformance.com/) - High-grade gymnastics/weightlifting chalk. Don't cheap out here. See **Kettlebell Prep**.~~ Vikn closed. I need to find a high-quality replacement.  Don't buy cheap chalk - your hands will thank you.
