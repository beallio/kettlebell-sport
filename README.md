# Introduction
Kettlebell Sport information is difficult to find on the internet, or limited in depth,scope,etc. This is my attempt to collect what I find.

## What is Kettlebell Sport?
[What is Kettlebell Sport? An Intro.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te3efrre6sg)

This is not Hardstyle (Pavel-influended) Kettlbell lifting.  Kettlebell Sport is endurance kettlebell lifting where lifters have 10 minutes (or 5 minutes in sprint sets) to complete as many reps as possible without setting the bells down.  Efficiency and technique are important to maintain energy throughout set.
