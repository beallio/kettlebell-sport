# Introduction
Kettlebell Sport information is difficult to find on the internet, or limited in depth,scope,etc. This is my attempt to collect what I find.

## What is Kettlebell Sport?

This is not Hardstyle (Pavel-influended) Kettlebell lifting.  Kettlebell Sport is endurance kettlebell lifting where lifters have 10 minutes (or 5 minutes in sprint sets) to complete as many reps as possible without setting the bells down.  Efficiency and technique are important to maintain energy throughout set.  

### Lifts
- **Long Cycle** - Clean and Jerk.  Commonly performed with 2 kettlebells, but one-arm variants performed for half-marathon and marathon.  Abbreviations include: LC (long cycle), TALC (two-arm long cycle), C+J (clean and jerk), OALC (one-arm long cycle).
- **Snatch** - Snatch.  Performed with one kettlebell.  Double-arm variant referred to as Double Snatch.
- **Jerk** - Jerk. Commonly performed with 2 kettlebells, but one-arm variants performed for half-marathon and marathon.  Abbreviations include: OAJ (one-arm jerk).
- **Double Half-snatch**.  Performed with two bells.  First part of lift is like a double snatch, but after fixation the athlete drops to the rack before the back swing.  Abbreviations include: HS (one-arm half-snatch), DHS (two-arm half-snatch).

## Accessories

### Belts
- [Lab of Champions](https://www.32kg.pro/online-store/KETTLEBELL-SPORT-PRO-BELTS-c11357019)
- [Bellevator](https://www.denisvasilevkettlebell.com/bellevator-lifting-belts)

### Miscellaneous
- [Magnetic Chip Weights](https://prokettlebell.com/collections/accessories/products/magnetic-chip-weights) - 1KG and 2KG magnetic plates you attach to base of Kettlebell.  Allows you to adjust weight in smaller increments than traditional 4KG jumps between bells.
    - The chip weights on a pair of Pro Kettlebells work great.  I haven't tried the PBK chip weights on a pair of standard competition bells though.  Previously, I wasn't a fan of attachment plates on traditional competition bells, because they shift (or detach) during two-bell sets (unless I would tape them down, but that defeats the easy on/off point of them).
- [Vikn Chalk](https://viknperformance.com/) - High-grade gymnastics/weightlifting chalk. Don't cheap out here. See **Kettlebell Prep**. (Note: As of Sept 1, 2023 they're back in business!) - (use **TCKB** for 10% off).  
- [Belt sander replacement belt](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DIABLO-3-in-x-18-in-80-Grit-Sanding-Belt-2-Pack-DCB318080S02G/202830831) - Used for sanding bell handles. See **Kettlebell Prep**.
- [Sanding Drum Kit for Drill Presses and Power Drills](https://www.homedepot.com/p/WEN-Sanding-Drum-Kit-for-Drill-Presses-and-Power-Drills-20-Piece-DS164/305175622) - Used for quickly prepping new bell handles, or if there's an extensive amount of rust build-up on the handle.
- [DeWalt 3-Tier Steel Garage Storage Shelving Unit](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-Yellow-3-Tier-Steel-Garage-Storage-Shelving-Unit-50-in-W-x-48-in-H-x-18-in-D-DXST4500/302361258) - Heavy duty multi-purpose shelf perfect for storing your kettlebells off the floor.  Holds 10 competition bells per shelf.  Less expensive, and more storage than kettlbell-specific shelves available on the market.
- [Tyr Lifting Shoes](https://www.tyr.com/footwear/l-1-lifting-shoe) - Lifters aren't required in the sport, but I find them beneficial in double bell lifts for the stability.  Tyr's are my new favorite weightlifting shoes, though I wore Adidas Adistars and Adipowers for 20+ years.  There other options from companies like: Nike, Reebok, No Bull, Do-Win, and Lab of Champions makes GS sport-specific lifters.
